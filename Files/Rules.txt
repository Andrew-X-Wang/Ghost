How to Play Ghost: 

Ghost is a Word game in which Players take turns adding Letters to a growing Word 
fragment (that I call a “Ghost” in the Program but no one else does), trying not to 
be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual
Word, starting from 3 Letter Words. Proper nouns count as Words in this game.

There are 2 modes of gameplay: Challenge the Computer, or play against other people.

If you find that there is a Word the Program does not recognize, you can always 
Submit a Complaint, and the Word will be added to “Complaints.txt” and most likely 
will not ever be considered.
